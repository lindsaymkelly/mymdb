# README

MyMDB is an application built as a clone of IMDB, where users can search for movies by a variety of keywords and see results appear instantly. This app was built to practice Rails, React, and working with APIs.  The data is pulled from the [OMDB API.](http://www.omdbapi.com/)

Also, thanks to [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) for their sweet CSS animation library.  You should check it out. 😁
